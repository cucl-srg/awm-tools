HOWTO_GENERATE_ATTRIBUTES
-------------------------

Using the attributegenerator software you can easily generate a set of attributes
for any network data (TCP/IP only i'm afraid at the moment).

Simply run this command:

./attributegenerator/bin/awmreduced *.tcpdump -a myOutput.arff

The *.tcpdump indicates that you can use wildcards in the command line. Having
learnt that UNIX imposes file size limitations, it is best splitting your network
data into several small files.

The -a option makes the program output any attribute data to the specified file

The program used in this example is awmreduced, this is an attribute generator for
Andrew Moore's reduced set of attributes (Moore, 2005). There is another program
included in this distribtion (portnumber) which only output's port information
for each flow detected in the input data.

See HOWTO_GENERATE_YOUR_OWN_ATTRIBUTES to learn how to create a different program.

There are some other command line options that can be used with the attribute
generation programs:

	-p <number> 
		- generate attributes for flows after sniffing a certain number
		  of packets
	-d <duration>
		- generate attributes for flows after a flow reaches a certain
		  duration (MUST FIND OUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE DURATION)
