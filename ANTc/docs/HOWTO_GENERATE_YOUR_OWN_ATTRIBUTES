HOWTO_CREATE_YOUR_OWN_ATTRIBUTES
-----------------------------

In order to create your own attributes you need to implement a shared library with
the following methods (./include/attributecalculator.h:

	- double * calculateattributes(struct netflowrecord * details, 
				       struct packetlinkedlist * startpacket, 
				       int * size);
	This method is called everytime the flow demultiplexer decides that a 
	flow has ended. 

	The parameters are:
	A netflowrecord with various details about the flow such as IP addresses, 
	port numbers and size.
	A packetlinkedlist which is a linkedlist containing all the packets in the
	trace.
	A pointer to an int which should be set to the number of attributes that
	your new attribute set is going to contain.
		- portnumber.c returns 2, source port and destination port

	- void setupattributecalculator();
        Called once when the rest of the modules are being set up
	If there is a ARFF_OUTPUT file then this can be used to initialise the
	file, by adding a header containing the attribute information

	An example of this can be seen in:/attributegenerator/src/portnumber.c
	where all of the methods have been implemented.


The Makefile then needs to be adjusted to use your new library. A typical entry
would contain:

newattribset:     packetgiver
        gcc -I./include/ -o ./lib/libmyAttributeSet.so ./src/myAttributeSet.c
						-shared -export-dynamic

        gcc -ggdb -I./include/ -L./lib/ -o ./bin/myAttributeSet 
		./src/packetgivercmd.c -lpacketgiver -lpcap -lmyAttributeSet -lm

This make command consists of three parts:

	Call the packetgiver command
	----------------------------
	Build the packetgiver module, this is the demultiplexer library

	Compile our new attribute set
	-----------------------------
	We compile our new attribute set as a shared library

	Compile the new program as myAttributeSet
	-----------------------------------------
	We then compile the whole program (including the driver program called
	packetgivercmd)
