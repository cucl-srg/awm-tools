Demultiplexing
--------------
- Defragment fragmented IP packets
	- Only 5 found in 13474 flows, therefore, we assume
	that they are from a broken link in this release
	However, we might have to investigate it.

No need to do (Kaysar Abdin)


Attribute Queries
-----------------

Should we drop retrans packets? They interfere with certain attributes
Although, they could be a contributing function to the 95% accuracy quoted
by awm. Is that the best solution? Should we only consider the packets that
were actually used in the flow?

(We should not discard retrans pkts - Kaysar Abdin)




Models
-------

Models to generate:

	- Kernel Density Only
	- Entire Data Set for All Attributes
	- Entire Data Set for awmreduced
	- Entire Data Set for portnumber

(Models have been built, should be located under weka-models dir
