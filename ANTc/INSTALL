INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANTc

        Download WEKA (Data Mining Tool)
        --------------------------------
        - http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

        Simply extract this file and then you have access
        to the weka.jar bundle

        Compile attributegenerator application
        --------------------------------------

        - cd ./attributegenerator/
        - make
	- Please ignore the warnings for now (14th August 2006)
	  they are needed or the hash table breaks (sorry awm)

        This will result in two (currently) different applications
        being compiled:
                - attributegenerator/bin/awmreduced
                - attributegenerator/bin/portnumber
        These two applications can be run to produce attribute files for
        both Andrew Moore's reduced set of 11 attributes (Moore, 2005) and
        a simple source port and destination port attribute file (to serve as
        an example of how to create your own attributes). See the man pages
	inside the docs directory for more information on these data sets.

        - See ./docs/HOWTO_GENERATE_ATTRIBUTES for information on how to
	generate your own attribute sets.

        Get some test data
        ------------------
        Use your favourite packet capturing tool to capture some network data.
        This data will serve as your training set so preferably this needs to
        be traffic from a variety of different applications.

        - e.g. Use your web browser, send an email, download something off FTP

	- e.g. tcpdump -i eth0 -w mydata.tcpdump -nn -t
